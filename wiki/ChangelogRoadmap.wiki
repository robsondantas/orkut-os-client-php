= Changelog =

  * Jan 5, 2011 - added list_friend_detail.php . Feature requested by Prashant Patil, allows you to pass an uid via querystring, returning detailed information from an user.


= Roadmap =

  * Add and improve log routines
  * Create a feature checking page, to determine if the hosting is capable of running this library (most issues related to curl and safe_mode)
  * Create a way to authenticate an user without needing to open the browser page. This might be done hacking around curl, too.
